                        <h2>Principles</h2>
                        <p>Wikipedia is an encyclopedia. It's a modern encyclopedia. We have a
                            certain perception of visual identity when we talk about encyclopedias.
                            an identity which reflects wisdom. at the same time, traditional
                            encyclopedias have a dated look and feel. This is also the big
                            difference between traditional knoweledge sharing and wikipedia.
                            Wikipedia is always evolving and we need to incorporate that into how it
                            looks.</p>
                        <p>Wikipedia is in an unique position of an old idea but fresh content. That
                            is exactly what we want to convey with our visual style. <em>&lt;make it
                                more about all projects, not just wikipedia&gt;</em>.</p>
                        <p>Paper was the largest medium for spreading knowledge. Today it is
                            computers. We borrowed values that are tied with old print media. values
                            like trustworthyness and <em>&lt;need word for seriousness or
                                academic&gt;</em>
                        </p>

                        <p>We start with basic elements like paper and ink, then extend it further
                            to match the needs of our visual character.</p>
                        <figure><img src="../assets/img/visualstyle-principles-papershadow.png"/></figure>
                        <p>Paper casts subtle shadows onto a base surface. paper has slightly
                            rounded corners due to it's organic nature.</p>
                        <figure><img src="../assets/img/visualstyle-principles-contentchrome.png"/></figure>
                        <p>We follow our design principles of content first. content precedes
                            chrome. content goes on paper, chrome stays on the base layer. <em>&lt;think
                                of better wording&rt;</em> make it obvious what is chrome.</p>
                        <figure><img src="../assets/img/visualstyle-principles-colortype.png"/></figure>
                        <p>Our color choices are inspired from black, white, and ink blue.
                            Typography has roots in traditional typefaces.</p>

                        <p>It is an uncommon mix of new and old media. Joyful yet trustworthy.<br>The
                            topics in this section are execution of these ideas.</p>

                    <!--<p>You can participate in many ways. The documentation is available in a Git repository with the design assets needed for your project. You can get all of them, change anything and send the changes back.</p>-->

                    <!--<h3>Getting the design repository</h3>-->
                    <!--The <a href="https://github.com/wikimedia/WikimediaUI-Style-Guide/">WikimediaUI Style Guide repository is available to download</a>. It contains this documentation, templates and further design resources. Select the “clone or download” button to get the repository.-->

                    <!--<h3>Committing changes</h3>-->
                    <!--<p>If you have <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git">Git</a> installed on your system, <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/cloning-a-repository/">cloning</a> is preferred way to get the contents since it allows you to contribute back. Technically changes can be submitted as usual in Git.</p>-->
                    <!--<p>In order to publish the updated contents to be available live, go to the repo and launch the following command from a terminal: <code>git push -f origin master:gh-pages</code></p>-->

                    <!--<h3>Changes beyond content</h3>-->
                    <!--<p>With the above instructions you can easily modify the content of the guidelines by adding new recommendations, making corrections or adding examples in the form of images or videos. Furthermore, you can also help improving how this documentation looks and works.</p>-->
                    <!--<p>When modifying aspects such as the CSS styling you'll need to rebuild the documentation files using <a href="http://gruntjs.com/">Grunt</a> (which requires <a href="https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node">Node.js and npm</a>). The first time you have to run <code>npm install</code> in a terminal from the guideline main folder in order to get all the needed dependencies. Every time you want to rebuild the CSS files for the documentation you just need to launch the <code>grunt</code> command in a terminal, also from the main folder.<br>-->
