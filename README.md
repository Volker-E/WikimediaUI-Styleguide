# Wikimedia Design Style Guide (WikimediaUI)

The Wikimedia Design Style Guide ensures a consistent look and behavior for our products.

The style guide features unique focus areas like accessibility, internationalization and localization, originating from large-scale websites, diverse languages and communities like Wikipedia.

Its guidelines aim to help designers and developers with their Wikimedia projects, as part of the Foundation or in a volunteer capacity.
